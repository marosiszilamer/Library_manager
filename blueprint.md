# Blueprint: Role-Based Access Control with Firebase

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to implement a role-based access control (RBAC) system for a web application. The goal is to differentiate between "admin" and "general user" roles, displaying content dynamically based on the logged-in user's role.

## Features

*   **User Authentication:** Users can register and log in to the application.
*   **Role-Based Access:**
    *   **Admin Role:** Users with the "admin" role have access to an exclusive admin panel.
    *   **General User Role:** Users without the "admin" role see the standard user content.
*   **Dynamic Content:** The application interface will change based on the user's role without requiring a page reload.
*   **Firestore Integration:** User roles will be stored and managed in a Firestore database.

## Implementation Plan

1.  **Firebase Setup:**
    *   Integrate Firebase Authentication for user management.
    *   Set up a Firestore database to store user roles.

2.  **Frontend Development:**
    *   Create a login and registration UI.
    *   Design an admin-only section and a general user section.
    *   Implement logic in JavaScript to show/hide elements based on the user's role retrieved from Firestore.

3.  **Styling:**
    *   Apply modern CSS for a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.
    *   Ensure the layout is responsive and works on different screen sizes.
